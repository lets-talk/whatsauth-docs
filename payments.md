When you decide which product fits your usage click the charge button and you will be directed to a new tab where you will complete the checkout (some browser could prevent the new tab to be open, please be aware of allowing this particular case).

On this screen, you can set your location to adjust currency, payment method, and Taxes.

You can also apply a coupon if you have one.
